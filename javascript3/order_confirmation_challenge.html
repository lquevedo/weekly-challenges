Use the following order inf o arrays:
 
order 1: 
    5 pairs of socks. These socks will hug your feet in a way that will make you feel like your grandmother knitted them herself. $5.00 each.
    3 shirts. Helping people feel cool in India’s intense heat made the fabric famous – so imagine how good our Madras Shirt will feel where you live. But we weren’t content to simply recreate the fabric. Although ours is woven in India like the original, we’ve improved it – with single-ply yarns that are ring­spun for strength and improved comfort. $25 each
     
     
order 2:
   1 Toddler Girls Jacquard Twirl Dress. This gathered waist twirl dress is perfect for dress-up days and special occasions, and she’ll absolutely adore the pretty prints & patterns. $22.00

For one thing, it’s made from durable, 600-denier polyester with a water-repellent finish.

In fact, we recommend making sure this is the pack they really want — it’s going to be with them a long time! $39.00
   1 School Uniform Women's Scallop Ballet Flats. Feminine, traditional, and versatile, with a touch of scalloped detailing to set them apart from your typical ballets.
